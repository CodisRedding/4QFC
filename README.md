# Generated MLS Fantasy Teams 2022

Since it takes such an insane amount of time to find all possible fantasy teams (runs for 4 days straight) i'm manually updating the
results in the format `week-{number}.json`. Until I can find an automated solution this is just how it is. This site shows those results. 

If you want to improve the team generator you can find it at https://github.com/CodisRedding/mls-fantasy-team-generator
