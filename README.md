* March 18th, 2022: Added week-3.json results (^5k teams)

# Generated MLS Fantasy Teams 2022

*note: Since it takes such an insane amount of time to find all possible fantasy teams (runs for 4 days straight) i'm manually updating the
results in the format `week-{number}.json`. Until I can find an automated solution this is just how it is. This site shows those results

# Run
