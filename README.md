* March 18th, 2022: Added week-3.json results (^5k teams)

# Generated MLS Fantasy Teams 2022

*note: Since it takes such a insane amount of number crunching to find all possible fantasy teams (runs for 4 days straight) I'm manually updating the
results in the format week-{number}.json. Until I can find an automated solution this is just how it is. 

# Run
